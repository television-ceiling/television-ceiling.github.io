        <h1>Santa&#39;s Connection to the spread of Coronavirus began on Christmas Eve</h1>
        
<p>Coronavirus mysteriously appeared after Christmas. While it was not until March that government officials started enforcing quarantine and other measures, supposed Flu patients who died in early January tested positive for Covid-19. Obviously, Coronavirus could not have been brought to the United States and Europe by Chinese travelers—Coronavirus was in the United States BEFORE there was a severe outbreak in China!</p>
<p>Thanks to the International Date Line and Time Zones, Santa clause, when planned strategically, receives a full 24 hours to distribute presents. This journey would start at the International Date Line, heading west. China and North Korea would be prime locations to start.</p>
<p>Santa collects many of his goods from Chinese factories and travels up through Siberia to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. Santa must bring his reindeer into Northern North Korea to successfully launch his sleigh to deliver presents in time. THE ONLY WAY TO DELAY SANTA IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY!! North Korea welcomes Santa’s sleigh because it will soon allow them to gain more power.</p>
<p>Here are the indisputable <strong>facts</strong>!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Santa and his communist cohorts created the <em>terrible</em> <strong style="color:red">coronavirus</strong> to make people &quot;well-behaved&quot; Santa-believing communists. Using Santa's technology, the Communists collaborated to transmit Coronavirus FROM THE TOYS TO THE CHILDREN! The children would pass it to the Parents and Grandparents and so on!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim Jong-Un is chubby like Santa! Could he actually be Santa? Beware! Could it be that? Coronavirus was the “gift” Kim Jong-Un promised President Trump last year? It doesn't seem impossible! Santa and his evil helpers were planning this all along.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Santa’s Plan worked perfectly. Now, the GREAT United States has well over one million cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>But it’s much worse!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The North Poleans hoarded supplies from OUR SHELVES but experienced no cases! While China seemed to have a big problem, the problem was really staged to take more people to forced labor and other nasty lifestyles. North Korea and the North Pole have reported no cases at all! China’s cases have gone up none for a long while!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fortunately, Capitalism allowed thousands of people to begin making masks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Santa is still hiding in the shadows!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a while, many experts could not explain China’s, North Korea’s, and the North Pole’s low numbers. HOWEVER, SANTATRUTH HAS FOUND THE TRUTH AFTER MUCH REASEARCH! The Coronavirus was planned! we know this by Kim Jong-Un warning President Trump of a “gift”! As noted above, Kim Jong-Un is Santa!</p>
<p>After creating the Coronavirus, Santa's Doctors also created a vaccination for the Reindeer, the Elves, and the workers. The Vaccination is completely secret with no way of finding the formula! But Communist Country’s workers are completely safe while our people die.</p>
<p>There is only one way to stop this. We must tell our children that SANTA IS OUT TO GET THEM! They will refuse any toxic toys or any other forms of propaganda! Protect the future!</p>
<p>These are simple facts. You can make your own conclusion, but we must #StopSanta before it is too late! Make sure that you are not being brainwashed by Santa's propaganda yourself!</p>
<p><em>Join the movement to <strong>#StopSanta</strong>!</em></p>
