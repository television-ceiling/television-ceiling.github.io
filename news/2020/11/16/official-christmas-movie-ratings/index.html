        <h1>Official Christmas Movie Ratings: We Watched Christmas Movies to Rate How Much They Promoted Communism</h1>
        
<h1 id="a-charlie-brown-christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</h1>
<p>A Charlie Brown Christmas does not portray Santa as a friendly comrade but fails to denounce Communism. In fact, characters complain about the commercialism of Christmas. At least the “true meaning of Christmas” does not conclude to be faith in Santa and Communism. Rating: 5/10</p>
<h1 id="miracle-on-34th-street">Miracle on 34th Street</h1>
<p>Miracle on 34th Street is fine until Santa proves himself real. It is fine to show to your children but make sure to stop it just after Santa announces he has failed the insanity test. Do not watch to the end! The movie ends with Santa proving himself to truly be Santa, people begin to believe in Santa, and he makes their wishes come true. Rating: 2/10</p>
<h1 id="how-the-grinch-stole-christmas!">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</h1>
<p>Not terrible, but the movie portrays Santa as a kind character. Also, the Grinch fails to denounce Santa once his heart has been converted. Rating: 3/10</p>
<h1 id="rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</h1>
<p>DO NOT WATCH! The Movie portrays Santa’s workshop in a favorable way, promoting the elves forceful toymaking activities. Some parts of the Communism do slip! There is a task driver who forces the elves about there business and one elf is fired after failing to achieve his assigned tasks. The poor elf could not even pursue the job he wanted! Rudolph is also rejected because of his red nose even though he is one of the finest reindeers. The movie, rather than showing Rudolph suing Santa, portrays Santa, Rudolph, and others being welcomed kindly back home before Rudolph assists Santa in brainwashing helpless children. This is a true example of Santa’s propaganda! Rating: 1/10</p>
<h1 id="frosty-the-snowman">Frosty the Snowman</h1>
<p>While not promoting Santa at first, the children’s “magical” snowman puts a poor magician benefiting from capitalism out of a job and Santa eventually saves Frosty’s life. Rating: 1/10</p>
<h1 id="the-year-without-a-santa-clause">The Year Without a Santa Clause</h1>
<p>Another dangerous film! The movie portrays Santa not wanting to go on his Christmas adventure. The elves try to prove that people still believe in Santa and eventually succeed. In conclusion, Santa decides to go on his journey because a little girl writes to him telling him how much she will miss him. This will make your children want to have Santa come! Rating: 1/10</p>
<h1 id="mr.-smith-goes-to-washington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</h1>
<p>The only good film! While not a Christmas film, still a worthy watch. The only problem is Mr. Smith beats the fellow capitalists, not communists. Also, Mr. Smith never denounces communism and Santa. At the very least, this will not brainwash your children and will teach then about freedom! Rating: 8/10</p>
<h1 id="it%E2%80%99s-a-wonderful-life">It’s a Wonderful Life</h1>
<p>Not terrible. Two notes of caution: First, one of George Bailey’s sons wears a Santa hat. Second, the film never denounces Communism and, in mild ways, portrays those who benefit from capitalism in an unfavorable way. Fortunately, the hero benefits from capitalism too. It is fine to watch but be sure to have a conversation with your children about the horrors of Communism after. Rating: 6/10</p>
